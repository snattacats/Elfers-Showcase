Version: 0.1.0
Author: Connor Elfers
Maintainer: The package maintainer <elfers.connor@gmail.com>
Description: This package analyzes Twitter data collected from uses about the (recent) Squid Games Netflix show. 
   The analysis consists of techniques from Pierce's Sign theory which includes analysis through triangulation methods
   by focusing on a tweet's likes(Impressions), retweets(Twitter_Activity), and Engagement. This package also includes pre-
   made functions in order to view analysis results. Function: graph.token tokenizes the tweet's comments, cleans and removes stopwords,
   arranges them by top 15 most frequent terms, and graphs them for your viewing pleasure. Function: graph.sentiment does the same
   thing as graph.tokenize but groups the terms based of a negative/positive sentiment and graphs top 10 for each group. Function:
   graph.trio produces 3 different graphs based off triangulation of the previous three aforementioned elements. The graphs include a 
   bar graph, line graph, and bubble graph. Other functions can be found in the markdown file with explanations.
